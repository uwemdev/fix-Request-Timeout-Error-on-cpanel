# fix-Request-Timeout-Error-on-cpanel

*Put The Code On Top Of The File (First Line)*

A simple line of code that fixes "Request Timeout Error" on cPanel

### Problem:
This request takes too long to process, it is timed out by the server. If it should not be timed out, please contact administrator of this web site to increase ‘Connection Timeout’.)

### Cause:
This particular error message is generated by the LiteSpeed web server (a faster replacement for Apache). It has a special feature whereby it cancels long-running scripts (even those that use set_time_limit()).

This happens if you have long running PHP scripts or due to Badly written PHP code.

This solution applies to any PHP SITEs (WordPress, Joomla, Custom Scripts, Custom Sites) running on Litespeed Webserver.
